# Image_Recolorer
<h3> A collection of a few image-processing scripts in python: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>filter.py - takes a collection of hex colors and replaces all the colors in an image with those colors, esentially recoloring the image.</li>
  <li>pallate_generator.py - takes an image and uses an implementation of k-means clustering to generate a list of n colors that make up that image.</li>
</ul>
