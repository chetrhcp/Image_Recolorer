# Image_Recolorer
A collection of a few image-processing scripts in python:
    filter.py - takes a collection of hex colors and replaces all the colors in an image with those colors, esentially recoloring the image.
    pallate_generator.py - takes an image and uses an implementation of k-means clustering to generate a list of n colors that make up that image.
